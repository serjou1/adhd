"""Recently-closed project history for adhd.

When a session closes — cleanly (SessionEnd) or by crash/power-off (its terminal
no longer hosts a live `claude`) — we record its project here so you can re-open
it later from the dashboard. The store is a single JSON file on disk, so it
survives app restarts, updates, and power loss: whatever was open before a crash
lands in history the next time adhd reaps its stale state file.

Capped at the most recent 10 distinct projects, keyed by root path. Writes are
atomic (tmp + os.replace), so the hook processes and the dashboard can append
concurrently without ever leaving a half-written file behind — a racing writer
can at worst lose a single update, never corrupt the store.
